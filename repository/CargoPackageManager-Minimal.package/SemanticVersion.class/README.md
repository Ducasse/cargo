This class represents a symbolic version as expressed in semantic versionning.
The format is MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.
examples:
	1.2.0
	1.1
	1.0-RC1

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
- PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

See http://semver.org/ for more details.
