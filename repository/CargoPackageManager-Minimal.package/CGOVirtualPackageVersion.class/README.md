I represent a specific version of a virtual package.
See CGOVirtualPackage for more information.

My main goal is to provide some metadata on a virtual package.
My description should describe the contract (i.e. the API) so that implementors and users of this virtual packages are aware of it.

example: Mongo@1.0
	* #open
	* #close
	* #query:
	* #queryOne:
