provisions
	"A package may provide a virtual package. A virtual package is one which appears in the provisions  of another package. The effect is as if the package(s) which provide a particular virtual package name had been listed by name everywhere the virtual package name appears. See https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s-virtual"
